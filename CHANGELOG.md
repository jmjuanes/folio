### Library: Your Personal Design Hub

We are excited to introduce **Folio Library**! This powerful new feature allows you to save, organize, and manage frequently used elements, making it easier than ever to streamline your creative process. Here is what you can do with the Library:

- **Import items to your Library**: When you import items, they are automatically grouped as a collection within your Library, making them easy to find and manage. This means you can seamlessly bring in design assets from previous projects or collections and keep everything organized.

The Library feature adds a new level of efficiency, allowing you to create, reuse, and organize elements effortlessly. It is designed to make your creative workflow smoother and more adaptable than ever.

### Shift Key Enhancements

The Shift key now unlocks even more functionality for enhanced control over your designs:

- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: When resizing shapes, images, and drawings, hold down the Shift key to maintain their original aspect ratio. Say goodbye to unintentional distortions!
- **Snap Lines and Arrows to Key Angles**: Adjusting the start or end point of lines and arrows with the Shift key pressed will now snap them to 15° increments. Perfect for creating clean and organized diagrams with precise alignment.
