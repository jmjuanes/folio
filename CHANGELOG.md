# v0.21.0 (August 25, 2024) Duplicate Pages and some Bug Fixes

> We have introduced the ability to duplicate entire pages, making it easier to create variations of your work. We have also fixed bugs related to curved arrows, ensuring accurate selection area calculations and preventing cropping when exporting to images.

## Duplicating Pages

We have added a highly requested feature: you can now duplicate entire pages within your whiteboard. This makes it easier than ever to create variations of your designs or work on multiple versions of your ideas without starting from scratch.

## Fixed Selection Area Calculation for Curved Arrows

We have resolved an issue where the total selection area was incorrectly calculated when it included a curved arrow. Now, the selection area will be accurately reflected for all elements.

## Fixed Image Export for Curved Arrows

We have also fixed a bug that caused curved arrows to be cropped when exporting the whiteboard to an image. Your exported images will now correctly include the full shape of curved arrows.


# v0.20.0 (July 11, 2024) New Layers Panel and Object Dimensions

> The latest update to Folio introduces a new Layers Panel, allowing users to manage elements with ease. Additionally, users can enable displaying dimensions for shapes, text, and selections for precise designs. 

## New Layers Panel

Introducing the Layers Panel, a powerful new feature that enhances your workflow by displaying all elements added to the board. This panel allows you to easily manage your elements, including changing the name, duplicating an element, or removing an element.

## Displaying Object Dimensions

We have added the ability to view object dimensions for shapes, text, and for a selection. This new feature helps you achieve precise designs by displaying the width and height of selected objects directly on the board.

Displaying dimensions can be enabled from *Menu* -> *Object dimensions*.
