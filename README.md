## Note: Folio is still a Work in Progress

We are excited to share our drawing application with you, but please be aware that it is currently in active development. While the app is fully functional and offers a range of features, we are continuously working to enhance and expand its capabilities.

You might encounter occasional bugs or experience features that are still being refined. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to deliver the best possible drawing experience.

We encourage you to share your thoughts, suggestions, and any issues you encounter.

## Features

- **Privacy First**: Your creative work is secure and private. Boards are saved directly in the user's browser, ensuring your data stays local and under your control.

- **Infinite Canvas**: Unleash your imagination on an infinite canvas. No limitations to size â€“ create small sketches or massive masterpieces with equal ease.

- **Export as Image**: Share your creations with the world. Export your entire drawing board as a high-resolution image to showcase your artistry.

- **Selective Screenshot**: Capture your ideas precisely. Take a screenshot of a user-defined region, so you can focus on the details that matter most.
