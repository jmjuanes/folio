## Note: Folio is still a Work in Progress

We're excited to share our drawing application with you, but please be aware that it's currently in active development. While the app is fully functional and offers a range of features, we're continuously working to enhance and expand its capabilities.

You might encounter occasional bugs or experience features that are still being refined. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to deliver the best possible drawing experience.

We encourage you to share your thoughts, suggestions, and any issues you encounter.

## Features
